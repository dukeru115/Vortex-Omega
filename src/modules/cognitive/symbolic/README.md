# NFCS Symbolic AI Module

## Overview

The Symbolic AI module provides hybrid neuro-symbolic processing capabilities for NFCS v2.4.3, implementing critical transformations between neural field dynamics and symbolic knowledge representations as specified in PDF Section 5.4.

**Last Updated**: September 14, 2025  
**Version**: 2.4.3  
**Author**: Team Ω - Neural Field Control Systems Research Group

## Scientific Foundation

This module implements the core neuro-symbolic transformations required for NFCS operation:

- **Symbolization**: `Φ(field) → symbolic` - Extract topological and semantic features from neural fields
- **Fieldization**: `symbolic → u(x,t)` - Generate control fields from symbolic constraints  
- **Verification**: `consistency(s,n)` - Measure symbolic-neural alignment using mutual information

## Key Components

### 1. SymbolicAI Core (`symbolic_ai.py`)

Primary symbolic reasoning engine implementing:
- Neural field pattern recognition and symbolic extraction
- Logical inference and knowledge graph integration
- Consistency verification between symbolic and neural representations
- Topological defect analysis for field-symbolic coherence

### 2. KnowledgeGraph (`knowledge_graph.py`)

Dynamic knowledge representation supporting:
- Concept nodes with semantic embeddings
- Relation edges with temporal dynamics
- Graph-based inference and reasoning
- Integration with neural field states

### 3. LogicEngine (`logic_engine.py`)

Formal reasoning capabilities including:
- Propositional and predicate logic inference
- Temporal logic for dynamic systems
- Constraint satisfaction and optimization
- Symbolic computation and manipulation

## Integration with NFCS Core

The Symbolic AI module seamlessly integrates with:
- **CGL Solver**: Converting field patterns to symbolic knowledge
- **Kuramoto Networks**: Symbolic coordination of multi-agent systems
- **ESC Module**: Enhanced semantic processing through symbolic reasoning
- **Constitutional Framework**: Logic-based safety validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Symbolic Processing

```python
from src.modules.cognitive.symbolic import SymbolicAI

# Initialize symbolic AI
symbolic_ai = SymbolicAI()

# Convert neural field to symbolic representation
neural_field = get_current_field()
symbolic_rep = symbolic_ai.symbolization(neural_field)

# Generate control field from symbolic query
query = SymbolicQuery(constraints=["stability", "efficiency"])
field_modulation = symbolic_ai.fieldization(query)

# Verify consistency
consistency = symbolic_ai.verification(symbolic_rep, neural_field)
```

### Knowledge Graph Operations

```python
from src.modules.cognitive.symbolic import KnowledgeGraph

# Create and populate knowledge graph
kg = KnowledgeGraph()
kg.add_concept("synchronization", embedding=sync_embedding)
kg.add_relation("causes", "synchronization", "stability")

# Query and reasoning
results = kg.query_concepts(["efficiency", "stability"])
inferred_relations = kg.infer_relations(depth=3)
```

### Logic-based Reasoning

```python
from src.modules.cognitive.symbolic import LogicEngine

# Initialize logic engine
logic = LogicEngine()

# Define rules and constraints
logic.add_rule("stable(system) :- synchronized(agents), bounded(field)")
logic.add_constraint("energy_efficient(control) :- minimal(effort)")

# Perform inference
conclusions = logic.infer(premises=["synchronized(agents)", "bounded(field)"])
```

## Scientific Validation

The module includes comprehensive validation against:
- **Topological Defect Density (ρ_def)**: Measures field-symbolic coherence
- **Hallucination Number (Ha)**: Quantifies symbolic accuracy and reliability
- **Consistency Metrics**: Mutual information and correlation measures
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Speed and accuracy of transformations

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters:
- `symbolization_threshold`: Minimum field strength for symbolic extraction
- `verification_tolerance`: Tolerance for consistency checking
- `inference_depth`: Maximum reasoning depth for logic engine
- `knowledge_graph_size`: Maximum nodes/edges in knowledge representation

## Testing and Validation

Run module tests:
```bash
python -m pytest src/modules/cognitive/symbolic/tests/ -v
```

Validate scientific accuracy:
```bash
python scripts/validate_symbolic_accuracy.py
```

## Integration Status
